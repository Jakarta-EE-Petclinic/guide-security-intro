Learn how to secure a web application through authentication and authorization.

// =================================================================================================
// What you'll learn
// =================================================================================================

== What you'll learn

You'll learn how to secure a web application by performing authentication and authorization using Jakarta EE Security. 
Authentication confirms the identity of the user by verifying a user's credentials while authorization
determines whether a user has access to restricted resources.

Jakarta EE Security provides capability to configure the basic authentication, form authentication or custom 
form authentication mechanism by using annotations in servlets. It also provides SecurityContext API for 
programmatic security checks in application code.

Youâ€™ll implement form authentication for a simple web frontend. You'll also learn to specify security 
constraints for a servlet and use the SecurityContext API to determine the role of a logged in user.

=== Try what you'll build

The `finish` directory in the root of this guide contains the finished application secured with form authentication. 
Give it a try before you proceed.

[role='command']
include::{common-includes}/twyb-intro.adoc[tag=runCommand]

Navigate your browser to this URL to access the application: http://localhost:9080[http://localhost:9080^]

The application automatically switches from an HTTP connection to a secure HTTPS connection 
and forwards you to a login page. If the browser gives you a certificate warning, it's because the 
Liberty server created a self-signed SSL certificate by default. You may follow your browser's 
provided instructions to accept the certificate and continue.

Sign into the application with one of the following user credentials from the user registry, 
which have been provided to you:

|===
|Username|Password|Role|Group

|alice
|alicepwd
|user
|Employee

|bob
|bobpwd
|admin, user
|Manager, Employee

|carl
|carlpwd
|admin, user
|TeamLead, Employee

|dave
|davepwd
|N/A
|PartTime
|===

Notice that when you sign in as Bob or Carl, the browser redirects to the `admin` page and you can view their names and roles. 
When you sign in as Alice, you can only view Alice's name.
When you sign in as Dave, you'll be blocked and will see a `Error 403: Authorization failed` message 
because Dave doesn't have a role supported by the application.

== Adding authentication and authorization

For this application, users will be asked to login with a form when they access the application. 
Users are authenticated and depending on their roles, they will be redirected to the pages that they 
are authorized to access. If authentication or authorization failed, users will be sent to an error page. 
The application supports two roles, `admin` and `user`.

Navigate to the `start` directory to begin.

#Create the `HomeServlet` class.#
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/ui/HomeServlet.java`
----

HomeServlet.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright,javaDoc1,javaDoc2']
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/ui/HomeServlet.java[]
----

The [hotspot=HomeServlet file=0]`HomeServlet` servlet is the entry point of the application. 
To enable form authentication for the [hotspot=HomeServlet  file=0]`HomeServlet` class, 
define the [hotspot=AuthenticationMechanism file=0]`@FormAuthenticationMechanismDefinition` annotation 
and set its [hotspot=loginToContinue file=0]`loginToContinue` attribute with a 
[hotspot=loginToContinue file=0]`@LoginToContinue` annotation defining [hotspot=loginPage file=0]`welcome.html` 
as the login page and [hotspot=errorPage file=0]`error.html` as the error page.

The [hotspot=loginPage file=0]`welcome.html` and [hotspot=errorPage file=0]`error.html` pages 
that implement the login form and error page respectively are provided for you under the 
`src/main/webapp` directory. The login form in the [hotspot=loginPage file=0]`welcome.html` page 
uses the `j_security_check` action, which is defined by Jakarta EE and available by default.

Authorization determines whether a user can access a resource. To restrict access to 
authenticated users with `user` and `admin` roles only, define the 
[hotspot=ServletSecurity file=0]`@ServletSecurity` annotation with the 
[hotspot=HttpConstraint file=0]`@HttpConstraint` annotation and set the 
[hotspot=HttpConstraint file=0]`rolesAllowed` attribute to these two roles.

The [hotspot=TransportGuarantee file=0]`transportGuarantee` attribute defines the constraint
on the traffic between the client and the application. 
Set it to [hotspot=TransportGuarantee file=0]`CONFIDENTIAL` to enforce that all user data must be encrypted, 
which is why an HTTP connection from a browser will be switched to an HTTPS one.

The SecurityContext interface provides programmatic access to Jakarta EE Security API. 
Inject a SecurityContext instance into the [hotspot=HomeServlet file=0]`HomeServlet` class. 
The [hotspot=doGet file=0]`doGet()` method uses the [hotspot=CallerInRole file=0]`isCallerInRole()` method 
from SecurityContext API to check a user's role and then forwards the response to the appropriate page.

The [hotspot=webxmlsecurity file=1]`src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml` file 
contains the rest of the security declaration for the application.

web.xml
[source, xml, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml[]
----

The [hotspot=security-role file=1]`<security-role/>` elements define the roles supported by the application, 
which are [hotspot=role-name-user file=1]`user` and [hotspot=role-name-admin file=1]`admin`. 
The [hotspot=security-constraint file=1]`<security-constraint/>` elements further specify that JSF resources 
like the [hotspot=url-pattern-user file=1]`user.jsf` and [hotspot=url-pattern-admin file=1]`admin.jsf` pages 
can only be accessed by users with [hotspot=role-name-user file=1]`user` and 
[hotspot=role-name-admin file=1]`admin` role respectively.

== Configuring the user registry

User registries store user account information, such as username and password, for use by applications 
to perform security-related operations. Typically, application servers would be configured to use an 
external registry like a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) registry and applications would 
access information in the registry for authentication and authorization using API like Jakarta EE Security API.

Open Liberty provides an easy-to-use basic user registry for developers, which you will configure.

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `UserRegistry` configuration file.#
`src/main/liberty/config/userRegistry.xml` 
----

userRegistry.xml
[source, xml, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/src/main/liberty/config/userRegistry.xml[]
----

The registry has four users, [hotspot=member-name-bob file=0]`bob`, [hotspot=member-name-alice file=0]`alice`, 
[hotspot=member-name-carl file=0]`carl` and [hotspot=member-name-dave file=0]`dave`, and four groups, 
[hotspot=group-name-Employee file=0]`Employee`, [hotspot=group-name-TeamLead file=0]`TeamLead`, 
[hotspot=group-name-Manager file=0]`Manager` and [hotspot=group-name-PartTime file=0]`PartTime`. 
Each user belongs to one or more groups.

It is not recommended to store passwords in plain text. The passwords in the [hotspot file=0]`userRegistry.xml` file
are encoded using the Liberty `securityUtility` command with XOR encoding.

The [hotspot=application-bnd file=1]`server.xml` file contains the security configuration of the server.

server.xml
[source, xml, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml[]
----

Use the [hotspot=location file=1]`<include/>` element to add the basic user registry configuration to your server configuration. 
Open Liberty will include configuration information from the specified XML file in its server configuration.

Map the groups in the user registry to the appropriate user roles supported by the application for proper user authorization. 
The [hotspot=group-name-Manager file=1]`Manager` and [hotspot=group-name-TeamLead file=1]`TeamLead` groups are mapped to the 
[hotspot=security-role-admin file=1]`admin` role while the [hotspot=group-name-Employee file=1]`Employee` group is mapped to the 
[hotspot=security-role-user file=1]`user` role using the [hotspot=Security file=1]`<security-role/>` and 
[hotspot=Group file=1]`<group/>` elements under the [hotspot=application-bnd file=1]`<application-bnd/>` configuration.

Point your browser to http://localhost:9080[http://localhost:9080^]. 
As you can see, the browser gets redirected from an HTTP connection to an HTTPS connection automatically, 
which is due to the transport guarantee defined in the [hotspot file=0]`HomeServlet` class.

You will see a login form since form authentication is implemented and configured. 
Sign into the application using one of the credentials from the following table, which is defined in the configured user registry.

|===
|Username|Password|Role|Group

|alice
|alicepwd
|user
|Employee

|bob
|bobpwd
|admin, user
|Manager, Employee

|carl
|carlpwd
|admin, user
|TeamLead, Employee

|dave
|davepwd
|N/A
|PartTime
|===

Notice that when you sign in as Bob or Carl, the browser redirects to the `admin` page and you can view their names and roles.
When you sign in as Alice, you can only view Alice's name.
When you sign in as Dave, you'll be blocked and will see a `Error 403: Authorization failed` message 
because Dave doesn't have a role supported by the application.

== Testing the application

Write [hotspot file=0]`SecurityIT` class to test the authentication and authorization of the application.

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `SecurityIT` class.#
`src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/security/SecurityIT.java`
----

SecurityIT.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/security/SecurityIT.java[]
----

The [hotspot=testAuthenticationFail]`testAuthenticationFail()` method tests an invalid user authentication 
while the [hotspot=testAuthorizationFail]`testAuthorizationFail()` method tests unauthorized access to the application.

The [hotspot=testAuthorizationForAdmin]`testAuthorizationForAdmin()` and 
[hotspot=testAuthorizationForUser]`testAuthorizationForUser()` methods, respectively, verify that a user with `admin` role 
and a user with `user` role are properly authenticated and can access authorized resource.
